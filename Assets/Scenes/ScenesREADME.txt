Dear TS and future me, I made SampleScene a template.
Copy the SampleScene when making new game levels.

It has BORDERS (Hormat Trump!!)
The play area is 60x40 for now. (according to Chatgpt's reccomendation)
No background graphics for now :(

It has CAMERA that follows Player.
    may not stick to the current camera following script if it looks bad

Now the player has 1 CircleCollider2D just to make sure it does not run out of border.
We will need to add more colliders to the Player in the future as hitbox.

HI future bryan, 
I only read this after making my own scene (tbh i didn't even know what a scene was 
until i read this) :(
luckily the changes needed were not extensive
Camera seems to follow nicely and borders seem to work :)
feel like the border a bit too small tho since vampire survivor need to move around quite a bit
maybe double the size?
THE WALL MUST BE EXTENDED!! AND MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT!!!
