Dear TS and future me, I made SampleScene a template.
Copy the SampleScene when making new game levels.

It has BORDERS (Hormat Trump!!)
The play area is 60x40 for now. (according to Chatgpt's reccomendation)
No background graphics for now :(

It has CAMERA that follows Player.
    may not stick to the current camera following script if it looks bad

Now the player has 1 CircleCollider2D just to make sure it does not run out of border.
We will need to add more colliders to the Player in the future as hitbox.
